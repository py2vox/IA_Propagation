# ü§ñ AI-Powered HF Propagation Analyzer

## üöÄ About The Project

This repository contains the code for an **advanced prototype and tech demo** of a High-Frequency (HF) radio propagation analyzer. The tool is designed to simulate and predict communication conditions between two geographical points using a modern, data-rich interface.

The key differentiator of this project is its use of an Artificial Intelligence model (Anthropic's Claude) to **generate realistic-looking data and analysis**, serving as a powerful proof-of-concept for a future, scientifically accurate tool.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **"Space Weather" Dashboard:** Real-time visualization of simulated solar and ionospheric data.
* **Intelligent Analysis:** Recommends the best times, frequencies, and antenna configurations.
* **Interactive Charts:** 24-hour visual forecasts, performance comparisons between bands, and more.
* **Modern UI:** Responsive design, dark mode, notifications, and locally saved presets.
* **Proof of Concept:** Demonstrates the viability of using AI to interpret complex propagation data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status: Prototype

It is crucial to understand that this is a **tech demo** and not a scientifically validated tool in its current state.

* **Simulated Data:** The application is **not connected to real scientific data sources** (like APIs from NOAA, NASA, etc.). It uses an AI to generate realistic responses for demonstration purposes.
* **Not Operational:** For the project to work as a real-world tool, the current API calls must be replaced with connections to live, verifiable data sources.
* **API Key Management:** The source code contains direct calls to an external API. In a production environment, API keys must be managed securely on a backend and never exposed on the client side.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **React**: The core library for building the UI.
* **TypeScript**: For robust and type-safe code.
* **Tailwind CSS**: For modern and rapid styling.
* **Recharts**: For creating interactive charts.
* **Lucide React**: For the icon suite.
* **Anthropic API (Claude)**: Used as the engine for data and analysis simulation.
