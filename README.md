## üì° Project Overview

This repository presents a **next-generation prototype** of a High-Frequency (HF) radio propagation analyzer. It leverages **Artificial Intelligence** to predict and simulate radio communication conditions between two geographic locations.

### üß† Why It‚Äôs Unique

Unlike traditional HF tools, this project integrates **Anthropic's Claude AI** to simulate realistic-looking ionospheric and solar conditions. Though not scientifically validated (yet), it demonstrates the potential of AI in RF communication analysis.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Space Weather Dashboard**  
  Real-time simulated data of solar activity and ionospheric behavior.

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**  
  Get suggestions for best frequencies, times, and antenna setups.

- **Interactive Visualizations**  
  24-hour propagation forecasts, band comparisons, and dynamic plots.

- **Modern UI/UX**  
  Responsive layout, dark mode, local storage for user presets.

- **Proof of Concept**  
  Built to validate the integration of AI into radio propagation modeling.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prototype Disclaimer

This project is **experimental and not ready for operational use**.

- üîπ **Simulated Data Only** ‚Äì No connection to real scientific sources (NOAA, NASA, etc.).
- üîπ **Not for Production** ‚Äì To become a working product, it needs integration with real-time, verifiable datasets.
- üîπ **API Keys Exposed** ‚Äì For demonstration purposes only. Keys should be secured via a backend in real deployments.
